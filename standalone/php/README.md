# Standalone PHP Scripts
These are the set of standalone PHP scripts that can be executed from the command line. In
other words, they do not need a web server to function. The main purpose of these scripts is
to demonstrate the use of the RunSignup API without adding in the complexity of using a 
web server. In addition, having the ability to run the scripts from the command line provides
a single path for displaying regular program output as well as debug and errors. When using
a webserver, it's not always easy to determine why a script is crashing (error code 500).
